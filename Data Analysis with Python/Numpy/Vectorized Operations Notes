Vectorzing an operation involves applying the whole operation to the array.

Example: 

a = np.array([0,1,2,3])
a + 10 would equal 10,11,12,13 # this operation would apply to every index of the array

# Important -- Numpy would not adjust array "a" but rather create a new array with the changed values: array([10,11,12,13)]

if you wanted to change a, you would just assign the new values to a 
a = a + 10 --->  a = ([10,11,12,13)]

you can also use other arrays to change an array
however the arrays must have the same shape

b = np.array([1,2,3,4)]
a = np.array([5,6,7,8])
a = a * b
a = np.array([1,12,21,32])
