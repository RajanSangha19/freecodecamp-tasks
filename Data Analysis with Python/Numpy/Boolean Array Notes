These notes will go through boolean arrays:

This is a boolean array : a = np.array([True,False,False,True])
outputting this array will give array([0,3]) as index 0 and 3 are true

we can use this for many examples:

here is an array:

b = np.array([0,1,2,3])
if I run b>=2 I will get:
array([False,False,True,True])

so if I do this:
b([b>=2])
I will get the output of:
array([2,3])
So this tells me that index 2 and 3 are bigger or equal to 2 

you must have array([condition]) and this will output the indexes that statisfy the condition

###### or is a | and and is a & when expressing conditions in the array #############
