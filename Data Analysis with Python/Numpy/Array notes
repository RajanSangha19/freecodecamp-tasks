a = np.customarray([1,2,3,4]) # this is how you make an array
# you can access certain values from this array to make a new array:
a[[1,0,3]]
# would give you a new array of 2,1,3

Numpy can also create multi-dimensional arrays:

For example:

a = np.array([
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
])

a.shape would give the shape of the array: (2,3)
a.ndim = how many dimensions is the array? : 2
a.size = 6 because there are 6 numbers
